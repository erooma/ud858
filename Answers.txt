Sessions are characterized by the following properties:

Session name (required)
highlights
duration (which will be allowed in 15 minute intervals)
typeOfSession which will be limited to four types; Workshop, Lecture, Symposium, and Keynote.
date
start time in 24hr notation
conference name to which the session belongs
location (eg, room number)
maxRegistered (the total number of allowed attendees)
spotsAvailable (the number of participants already registered for a session)
speaker (in two parts, both first and last names to improve search capabilities).

Multiple sessions can take place simultaneously in a conference, as there are no current restrictions on time.

Sessions are linked to a conference (as its ancestor) through the conference websafeConferenceKey (or websafeCK), which is required to create the conference. Only the owner of a conference can create the sessions for that conference.

Sessions can be searched by means of conference, conference and speaker (using both first and last names), and session type (across conferences).

A users wishlist can be created (as per instructions). Please note that this does not adjust the session attendees, since it is not a solid registration function per se (future implementation).

Queries

Two additional queries have been added to the progam's features. 

One query is searching for sessions on a particular date (getSessionsByDate). This is conference agnostic.

The second query is searching for sessions in a particular conference that still have availability (getAvailableSessions). This assumes that tickets are required for all sessions, or that each event has limited capacity.

A query looking for all non-workshop sessions before 7 pm is problematic because Google Datastore does not allow for more than one query involving inequality. As a result,a direct query (eg, Types != Workshop and SessionTime < 19:00 can not be implemented).  

In order to solve this query, one needs to first obtain all sessions before 7 pm, and then if Types is limited by a few categories only, one could limit the search further by Types=Lecture, Types=Symposium, etc, adding these queries together and simply not including Workshop.

Or one can obtain all sessions before 7, then obtain all of these sessions whose Type=Workshop, and using code to 'subtract' these entries from the findings without using the database (eg, code-based).
